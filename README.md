This is my previous, now abandoned bachelor thesis. The idea was to write a
simple Lisp interpreter in C and a C code generation library in that Lisp
capable of generating the C code for the entire Lisp interpreter. That would
create a simple self-hosting system upon which I could later expand with an
extensible and hackable compiler.

I am still interested in writing a better programming language, but I no longer
believe this is the best way to go about it. I don't know what is yet, it might
not be Lisp-based.
